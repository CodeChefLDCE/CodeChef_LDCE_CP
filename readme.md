### An Open Source Repository of CodeChef LDCE for having all useful CP codes.
## Data Structures & Algorithm
Contribute only verified codes which are useful for Competitive Programming and DSA, NO submission for any CodeChef,Codeforces or LeetCode problem would be merged

Note: You can check the contributed codes and make required changes in case of any mistake in code or file an issue for the same.

Feel free to Contribute.

<b><h2>Guidlines To Commit</b></h2>
- Don't use your Cp Template shortcuts in the codes you are contributing in this repository.
- Contribute the algorithms in their relevant folders(Make the necessary folders if required) and not anywhere outside as a file.
- Make necessary changes in readme file and add the topic name with the link of the file you are commiting.
- All files/folders should follow [Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) naming convention.
- Make sure to add a little explanation of what is happening in the code along with Time Complexity.
